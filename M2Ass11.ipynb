This type of test is also known as a directional test. For example, if we want to test whether a new drug increases the mean survival rate of patients, we can use a one-tailed test with the alternative hypothesis being that the mean survival rate is greater than a specified value (i.e., the null hypothesis is that the mean survival rate is not greater than the specified value).\n",

    "Therefore, we can say that the caffeine has a significant effect on reaction time at a 90% confidence level."
