    "Measures of dispersion such as range, variance, and standard deviation are used to describe the spread or variability of a dataset. They give an indication of how much the data values deviate from the central tendency of the dataset.\n",

    "Variance and standard deviation are more robust measures of dispersion that take into account the deviations of all the values from the mean. Variance is the average of the squared deviations from the mean, while the standard deviation is the square root of the variance.

The standard deviation of Dataset A is the square root of 200, or approximately 14.14, while the standard deviation of Dataset B is the square root of 200/3, or approximately 5.16. Therefore, Dataset A is more spread out than Dataset B, as indicated by its larger variance and standard deviation."
