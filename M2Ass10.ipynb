    "Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to determine whether a given hypothesis about a population parameter is true or false. In hypothesis testing, we start with a null hypothesis, which is a statement that the population parameter is equal to a certain value.

Based on this likelihood, we either reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
